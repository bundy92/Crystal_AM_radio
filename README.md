# Crystal/Foxhole Radio

This project aims to provide a practical guide for building a simple AM radio receiver using minimal components, commonly known as a crystal or foxhole radio. The project includes both theoretical insights and practical instructions for constructing the radio using KiCad, a popular electronic design automation tool.

## Overview

Crystal/foxhole radios are rudimentary radio receivers that utilize crystal diode rectification to demodulate radio signals. Despite their simplicity, these radios can receive AM radio broadcasts with only a handful of components, making them an excellent educational tool for understanding basic radio principles.

## Features

- Detailed explanation of the principles behind crystal/foxhole radios.
- Step-by-step guide for building a crystal/foxhole radio using KiCad.
- Schematic diagram and component list for easy reference.
- Additional information on tuning, demodulation, and antenna design.
- Educational insights into semiconductor physics and radio frequency (RF) electronics.

## Requirements

To build the crystal/foxhole radio using KiCad, you'll need:

- KiCad software installed on your computer (available for free from [kicad.org](https://www.kicad.org/)).
- Basic understanding of electronics and circuit design.
- Access to electronic components such as inductors, capacitors, diodes, and a piezoelectric earpiece.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the KiCad project file (.pro) using KiCad's schematic editor.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the project documentation to design and layout the crystal/foxhole radio circuit.
4. Source the required components and assemble the radio according to the schematic diagram.
5. Test the radio by connecting an antenna and tuning to different radio stations.
